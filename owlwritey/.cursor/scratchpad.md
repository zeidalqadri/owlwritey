# WhatsApp Web Voice-Note Transcriber - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Building a privacy-first Chrome extension that transcribes WhatsApp Web voice messages locally using Whisper via Transformers.js. The extension will work entirely on-device with no data leaving the host machine.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Local transcription using Whisper models via Transformers.js
- Audio blob extraction and conversion from WhatsApp Web
- IndexedDB for persistent storage
- Chrome extension manifest v3 compliance
- Battery optimization and resource management
- Multilingual support with auto-detection
- Post-launch console errors related to:
  ‚Ä¢ Authorization failures (403/410) when our `extractAudioBlob()` hits WhatsApp CDN before a local `blob:` is available.
  ‚Ä¢ Worker event-listener timing ("x-storagemutated-1").
  ‚Ä¢ Browser security header warning ‚Äì `Permissions-Policy: interest-cohort` is no longer recognised since Chrome 115+, yet WhatsApp's CDN still serves it, triggering a noisy but harmless warning on every navigation.

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Bug Fixes (NEW)

> Each task below is broken down into small executable steps. The **Executor** should complete ONE numbered step at a time, mark it ‚úì when done (and validated), then request confirmation before moving to the next step.

#### üêû Task 18 ‚Äì Console Error Audit & Categorisation
18.1  Reproduce the console errors in a clean Chrome profile with only our extension enabled.  
18.2  Capture full console logs (filter by our script URLs) and annotate which originate from: extension code, WhatsApp code, or browser/security.  
18.3  Summarise each unique error/warning: message, source file, line, stack snippet, frequency.  
18.4  Decide which ones are actionable by the extension and which are external noise.  
**Success Criteria:** A markdown table added to scratchpad with the above info and "actionable?" column.

#### üêô Task 19 ‚Äì Reliable Audio Extraction Refactor
19.1  Investigate WA DOM: when/where does `<audio src="blob:‚Ä¶">` appear after user presses play?  
19.2  Prototype a helper `await getPlayableAudioBlob(messageEl)` that:
   ‚Ä¢ waits max 5 s for an `<audio>` child with a `blob:` URL;  
   ‚Ä¢ if none, invokes WhatsApp's internal `window.WWebJS?.downloadMedia` or similar (feature-detect);  
   ‚Ä¢ returns a `Blob` with proper MIME (`audio/ogg; codecs=opus`).  
19.3  Ensure `fetch` is called with `{ credentials: 'include' }` when using WA CDN URLs.  
19.4  Update `extractAudioBlob()` in `content.js` to use this helper and remove direct CDN fetch.  
19.5  Add exponential-backoff retry (max 3) for transient 403/410 before failing.  
**Success Criteria:** Playing a voice note once makes the helper resolve a valid Blob (verified via `blob.size > 0`) for three different chats; no 403/410 errors appear for these cases.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Task 20 ‚Äì Enhanced Error-Handling Messaging
20.1  Map HTTP status codes ‚Üí user-friendly messages:
   ‚Ä¢ 403 ‚Üí "Access denied ‚Äì refresh or reopen chat".  
   ‚Ä¢ 410 ‚Üí "Message expired ‚Äì ask sender to resend".  
   ‚Ä¢ >=500 ‚Üí "WhatsApp server error ‚Äì try again later".  
20.2  Refactor `showError()` to use this map and include a small grey "details" accordion with the raw status line.  
20.3  Add toast notifications for unrecoverable errors.  
**Success Criteria:** Triggering mocked 403 & 410 responses shows the mapped messages without crashing; unit tests pass.

#### üîß Task 21 ‚Äì Worker Event-Listener Fix
21.1  Search `service_worker.js` and `whisper-worker.js` for any dynamic `addEventListener` calls inside functions; move them to top-level scope.  
21.2  Build & reload extension; verify "x-storagemutated-1" warning disappears (may still appear from WA scripts ‚Üí acceptable).  
**Success Criteria:** No worker-related warnings originating from our files in console on page load.

#### üìú Task 22 ‚Äì Permissions-Policy Header Review
22.1  Use DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí filter `chrome-extension://` to confirm no extension resource is served with a `Permissions-Policy` response header.  
22.2  Verify we have no `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` or `chrome.webRequest` listeners modifying response headers.  
22.3  Grep the entire codebase for `interest-cohort` or `Permissions-Policy` to ensure we don't set it.  
22.4  Add a short explanatory note ("Warning originates from WhatsApp CDN; Chrome dropped FLoC 'interest-cohort', so header is ignored.") to the *Lessons* section below and to the README *Troubleshooting* subsection.  
**Success Criteria:**  
  ‚Ä¢ Codebase shows zero matches for `interest-cohort`.  
  ‚Ä¢ README contains the troubleshooting note.  
  ‚Ä¢ Console still shows the warning (expected) but is classified as external noise in Task 18 table.

#### ‚úÖ Task 23 ‚Äì Regression Tests
23.1  Write Jest tests for new `getPlayableAudioBlob()` logic using mocked fetch responses (200, 403, 410).  
23.2  Write tests asserting `showError()` maps codes correctly.  
23.3  Add a Puppeteer e2e test that plays a sample voice note and verifies no console 403/410 logs under extension's namespace.  
**Success Criteria:** All new tests pass in CI (or `npm test`).
